# BATS_zooplankton
Scripts used for the study of zooplankton at the BATS site. 

"Silva to Mothur.sh" allows to transform the SILVA database files (fasta and taxonomy) into mothur-friendly files. This allows to use the whole SILVA database, and not only the NR99 (that would collapse even superfamilies in many cases).

MothurScript.sh is just the mothur steps followed in the manuscript TITLE TO BE ADDED ONCE ACCEPTED. There are many faster ways to do the same nowadays.
